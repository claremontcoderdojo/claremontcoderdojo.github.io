# Claremont Coder Club

The Claremont Coder Club is a place for young people in [Claremont, NH](https://www.claremontnh.com/),
and the Upper Valley to hang out and learn technology the best way possible&mdash;by playing!

Absolutely everyone can learn to program. You don't need to be good at math or science to learn to program. You can start at any age---younger or older.

## We Need You

Currently, we are developing projects. As we go, we're posting everything on this site. Please follow along, try it out, and let us what you think. We'd love your feedback.

Get started with [Project 1](projects/01-turtle-time). You can do it right here in the browser.

## Common Myths About Programming

Here are a few things you might have heard about computers or programming that really arenâ€™t true.

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
|You need to be a genius to program. | Not at all! Anyone can learn to code. **You can learn to code.**|
|If I do it wrong, I'll break the computer | Unless you hit your computer with a bat, you can't break the computer. Experiment! Professional software engineers make mistakes every single day. The good ones are especially skilled at identifying mistakes and *fixing*, not avoiding, them.|
|Coding is too hard.| Coding is just like other skills---painting, cooking, or weight lifting. The more practice you put in, the better you'll get at it.|
|You need to go to college to learn to code.| Many great professional programmers are self-taught. But it's more fun if you join the club!|

## Get Started Right Now!
You have everything you need to start right now. Go to [Project 1](projects/01-turtle-time).

Once you start coding, you will feel big and powerful and strong. (Because you *will be* big and powerful and strong.)
