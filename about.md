# About the Claremont Coding Club

The Claremont Coder Club is a place for young people in [Claremont, NH](https://www.claremontnh.com/),
and the Upper Valley to hang out and learn technology the best way possible&mdash;by playing!

Absolutely everyone can learn to program. You don't need to be good at math or science to learn to program. You can start at any age---younger or older.

## The Projects

The projects on this page were developed for an after-school middle school program (grades 6--8). They have been successfully completed by kids as young as ten and grown-ups who are much, much older.

The idea for the turtle introduced in Project 1 was inspired by [Logo the Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), developed in the 1960s. The turtle was selected for a number of reasons:

* The turtle provides immediate visual feedback, which is useful in troubleshooting.
* The turtle has a direct physical analogue; you can pretend to be the turtle and execute your own programs by walking.
* The turtle is a method for artistic and personal expression.
* The turtle can be extended used to learn all of the foundational techniques in general programming.
* The turtle is simple.
* The turtle is *fun*.

Many of the projects were inspired by the charming (and sophisticated) book [Turtle Geometry](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262010634/) by Hal Abelson and Andrea DiSessa. It is available fully and freely from the MIT Press [online](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4663/Turtle-GeometryThe-Computer-as-a-Medium-for).

## What You Will Learn
The projects are intended to be done in sequence but are more or less self-contained. Throughout the projects, you will gain practice with four fundamental ideas in programming:

1. Data storage
2. Decision making
3. Repetition of tasks
4. Code organization and programming style

Additionally, you will learn how to problem-solve using these four ideas in JavaScript, a popular modern programming language.

After completing these projects, you will be able to embark on projects of your own design and have the foundational knowledge required to learn more about programming on your own!
