# What is Coding?

Coding, or programming, is a style of writing. When you code, you use a special programming language to write programs that a computer can run. In fact, each programming language is implemented by a computer program that knows how to interpret language! We will use a programming language called JavaScript in our projects.

JavaScript is a good choice to learn because it common language used in web programming. It is a convenient choice because you already have a program that knows how interpret JavaScript---the web browser you are using to view this page! So there's nothing to install to get started.

Unlike human languages, which comprise thousands upon thousands of distinct words, programming languages typically have only a few dozen built-in or special *keywords* to learn. So programming languages are, in a sense, much simpler.

## What Can You Do?

Programming languages are powerful. You can write any program in just about any programming language. (Even other programming languages!) Despite their power, there are very few things you can do. In fact, there are only *four*. Any new technology or technique you run across is a cousin to one or more of the four friends you will make in these projects. They are:

1. **Store data and retrieve it later to use.** Your friend for data storage is a *constant*, a value which can never be updated, which uses the special keyword <code>const</code> in code. Other friends in this category is a *variable*, a value which can be updated, which uses the special keyword <code>let</code> in code.
2. **Decide between alternatives.** Your friend for decision-making is the if statement, which uses the special keywords <code>if</code> in code. These kinds features add decision-making into programs. Conditional elements put the "sometimes" into programs that would otherwise be "always" based on context and circumstance.
3. **Repeat things.** The ability to repeat things quickly is what makes computers so useful. Your friend for repetition is the for-loop, which uses the special keyword `for`in code.
4. **Organize code.** This last ability is the most useful of the four. It's all about organizing your programs into pieces that are easy for people to read, understand, expand, troubleshoot, and fix. This ability is sometimes called *programming style* and you should aim to write with good style. Your friend for organization and style is the function, which uses the special keyword <code>function</code>.

That's it!

But don't let the short length of this list fool you. Each of the four categories takes a lot practice to master. You will have ample opportunity to play with data storage and retrieval, make decisions between alternative, repeat actions, and organize your code with these projects to build some very cool things.

## How to Learn

Practice playing with your four friends. Don't worry if it takes a lot of time to work through a single problem. Programming takes patience, persistence, and a lot of playing! If your programs don't behave the way you expect the first time, don't worry. Try to understand _why_ they are doing something different than what you hoped for and imagine different ways to use your four friends to accomplish what you aimed to do.

Whenever you get stuck, ask yourself which of these four friends would be helpful. When you learn a new programming technique, try to identify which of your four programming friends is this new thing most like. Keeping these four ideas in the back of your head will help you write better, clearer programs.
