# Project 3: More Functions

## Big Squares, Little Squares
1. Define a new function `biggerSquare()` that traces out a square path with sides 40 steps long.
2. Define a new function `biggerTriangle()` that traces out an equilateral triangle path of side length 50.
2. Use the functions `square()`, `biggerSquare()`, `triangle()`, and `biggerTriangle()` to create a drawing that you are proud of.

### Colors

The example drawing uses the colors `springgreen`, `yellowgreen`, `lawngreen`, `orange`, `violet`, and `deeppink`. In case you forgot, here is the [full list of colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors) the turtle knows by name.
